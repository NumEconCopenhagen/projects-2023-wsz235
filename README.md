1. Inaugural project. This project examines the household specialization model and aims to understand how households allocate their time and labor to maximize utility. The model focuses on a two-member household, where each member engages in two distinct markets: market work and home production. In addition to the original model, an extension is introduced by including disutility of household production.

2. Data project. We uses data from Statistics Denmark to examine the trends and patterns of the gender wage gap and part-time work in different sectors. We find that decreasing gender wage gap over time in both sectors, with a notably smaller gap in the municipal government sector. The regional government sector had a higher share of female workers, while the municipal government sector had a higher proportion of female part-time workers, indicating distinct labor market dynamics between the two sectors with more part-time opportunities for women in the municipal government sector.

3. Model project. We model anCournot competition model with n firms. Specifically, we consider an economy with multiple identical firms that produce the same homogenous good. First we solve the model for to firms and later see what happens when the number of firms increases.
