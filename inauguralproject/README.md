# Inaugural project

This project explores a model that aims to understand how households allocate their time and labor to maximize overall utility. The model focuses on a two-member household, where each member engages in two distinct markets: market work and home production. In addition to the original model, an extension is introduced in this project by incorporating disutility of household production, which can influence their decision-making regarding the allocation of time between market work and home production.
