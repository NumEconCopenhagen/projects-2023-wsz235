# Inaugural project

This project examines a model that explains how a household divide and specialize their labour to maximize utility and productivity. A household divides their time and labour into two markets, with each member specializing in the task that they are most efficient at completing. The household has two members, a female and a male memeber and can be used to explain gender roles within households. 

In this project, we will explore how the model can be used to analyze and improve the efficiency of household production.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb].
