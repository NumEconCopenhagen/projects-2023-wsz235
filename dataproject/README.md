# Data analysis project

Our project is titled 'The Gender Wage Gap and Part-time workers' and is about examine the trends and patterns of the gender wage gap and part-time work in different sectors and understand the factors that may contribute to these differences.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We used data from Statistics Denmark, and the code to access their API is available in the ipynb file.

**Dependencies:** No other installations are required for the project, except for a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation.
