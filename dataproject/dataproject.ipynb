    "In this project, we examine the gender wage gap in various sectors in Denmark and how it has developed over time. Many other studies have shown that education and work experience do not have an impact on the gender wage gap. Therefore, we will also look at the share of female part-time workers in these sectors and how it has changed over the years. Women may be more likely to work part-time than men, often due to caregiving responsibilities or other factors.\n",

To select the variables to download, we use the variables argument, which is a dictionary where the keys are the variable names, and the values are lists of the values to select. By using {'KØN': ['K']}, we only select observations where the gender is female. We filter the data to include all salary earners in Denmark. We also choose to look at earnings in DKK per hour to facilitate wage comparisons between full-time and part-time workers.\n",
