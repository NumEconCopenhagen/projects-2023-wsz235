    "In this project, we will analyze the gender wage gap in various sectors in Denmark and how it has developed over time. Many other studies have shown that education and work experience do not have an impact on the gender wage gap. Therefore, we will also examine the share of female part-time workers in these sectors and how it has changed over the years. Women may be more likely to work part-time than men, often due to caregiving responsibilities or other factors.\n",

    "In conclusion, this project analyzed the gender wage gap and the share of female workers in different sectors in Denmark. Using data from Statistics Denmark the results showed that the gender wage gap has decreased over time in both sectors, but it was significantly smaller in the municipal government sector. Additionally, the share of female workers was higher in the regional government sector, but the municipal government sector had a higher proportion of female part-time workers. These findings suggest that the two sectors have different labor market dynamics, with the municipal government sector offering more part-time work opportunities for female employees compared to the regional government sector. \n",

    "Overall, this analysis provides insights into the trends and patterns of gender wage gap and part-time work in different sectors and can help us understand the factors that contribute to these differences."
