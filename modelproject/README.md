# Model analysis project

This project aims to analyze the Cournot competition model with n firms. Specifically, we consider an economy with multiple identical firms that produce the same homogenous good.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
