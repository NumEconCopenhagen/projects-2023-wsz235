    "This project provides an examination of the dynamics of the Cournot model, exploring how firms interact to maximize profits while considering the output levels of their competitors. Initially assuming two firms in the market, we begin by constructing the model, detailing the mathematical basis, which includes profit functions, best response functions, and the iterative process of equilibrium determination. Following that, we extend our analysis to involve varying parameters and numbers of firms, to provide clearer insights into understanding the markets, their equilibrium conditions, and the competitive dynamics at play as the number of firms varies. Through this project, we aim to offer intuitive insights into the behavior of firms and the implications for market outcomes."
